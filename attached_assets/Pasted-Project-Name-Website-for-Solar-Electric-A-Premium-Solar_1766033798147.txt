🛠️ Recommended Tools to Use This Prompt
If you are building this yourself, I recommend these platforms:

Framer or Webflow: Best for that "High-End" professional look with animations.

Hostinger AI Builder: Very fast for generating a functional site in minutes using the prompt above.

WordPress with Elementor: Best if you want total control over the WhatsApp widget and SEO.

💡 Pro-Tips for "Solar Electric"
Real Photos Matter: Don't just use stock photos. If you have completed a project in Pakistan, put a real photo of that house. It builds massive trust.

Negotiation Strategy: Since you mentioned prices are negotiable, use "Starting from..." on your price tables. It makes the customer feel they can get a better deal when they click your WhatsApp button.

Local SEO: Make sure to mention the cities you serve (e.g., "Best Solar Installation in Lahore/Karachi") in the text so people find you on Google.
